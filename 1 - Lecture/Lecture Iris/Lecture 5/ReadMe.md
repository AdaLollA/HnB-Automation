- presentation was very nice - well thought-through

Are the costs for implementing the NFC Chip into the hand also calculated?

### Group 3

- set time for gaming by home automation - enforced by parents
- Toilet paper recorder (flic smart buttons)

Why not using Philips Hue but another system? -> Asked by Manuel

### Group 4
- Scenario guy very environment friendly
- using Loxone a lot
- invested a lot of thoughts in power redundancy and how much energy would be used by all the devices
- detect whether windows are open or closed
- close shutters automatically when room gets too hot
- context aware lighting

Why did you choose to get all your devices from Loxone? Seems extremely expensive?
