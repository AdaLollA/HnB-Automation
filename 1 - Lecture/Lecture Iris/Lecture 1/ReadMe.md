## Self Presentation
### Who are you?
- Iris PÃ¶chtrager, 23 years old
- Studied Software Engineering in the Bachelor, now Mobile Computing
- Working at softaware in Asten

### What do I expect from H&B Automation?
I expect to learn how I can automate a few thing myself at home - f.e. lights, and other things. I expect to get a kickstart in this area to be easily able to deepen the knowledge later if I want to.

### If I were in a team with 4 persons, I would bring to the table:
#### Strengths
- Punctuality
- Perfectionism
- Accuracy

#### Weaknesses
- Sometimes not a lot of time & a little stressed
- Impatient
- Perfectionism


## Videos
### Big Bang Theorie
- Turning on light
- Turning on stereo
- Racing cars
- Public access to turning on/off things
- Sending signal over internet
- Very feasible - done today

### Siemens Video
- Very fast elevators - increase efficiency
- Increase comfort, security, safety
- Using Holograms to interact with
- Not yet feasible - maybe with AR
- Siemens video 
- Exchange blocks of a building (use as elevator??!) - not feasible
- Intelligent energy management system -> mix in from public system
- Consumption optimization - integrate in building management system
- Guide people through buildings with signals on their phone
- Safe evacuation with system - emergency mode, with lights and sounds
- Separate people when safe rooms are full
- Networking city districts

### Bosch Videos
- Mow the lawn like a bosch: let all lawn mowers go at same time
- Park like a bosch video: automated parking
- Wake up like a bsoch: automatic coffee brewing

### Domains:
- Security Domain
- Energy Management
- Navigation and Routing
- Home Automation
- Resource Management
- Privacy (mentioned negatively)

### Technologies:
- Machine to machine communication (lawn mowers)
- Lights
- Wireless Communication
- Virtual Reality
- Remote Control/External Access
- Cloud
- Synthesis/Integration

### Crazy/Weird:
- Lack of privacy (Cars)
- Remote Access (Cars)
- Building with block came out to be used as an elevator


### Feasibility:
- Holograms possible to do (with AR/VR)
- Lots of things in Bosch videos feasible!
