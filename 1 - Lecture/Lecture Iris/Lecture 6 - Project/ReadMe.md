# Lecture 6 - Project 3
The things that were still to do from Lecture 5 can be found in the ReadMe of Lecture 5 as most was done on that day.

## Project 3 - Thoughts/Opinion
The work on Project 3 was quite pleasant with my colleagues. Everybody tried to do his best and contributed to the project. Michael did again most of the hardware setup. Manuel worked a lot on Mycroft AI. Alex and Lorenz figured the water gardening out together and I did the OpenHab integration.

This time, I had some troubles with OpenHab. I have never tried to integrate a rule on OpenHab or something similar before, so figuring out, how I had to add the items in the .items file and the rules in the .rules file took quite a lot of time. Furthermore, figuring out that I had to set the channel of the items in the .items file and what I had to set it too also wasn't that easy. The documentation of OpenHab was quite confusing for me regarding this. Also when writing the actual rules there occured a lot of problems. After finding the logs and using them to debug the rules, I was after some time able to set up the rules correctly. But when this finally worked, it was definitely a success feeling for me.

Also the video was a lot of teamwork, though Manuel did the whole work on cutting the video together.
