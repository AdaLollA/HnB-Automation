# Lecture 7 - Project Presentations
## Chemsident Automation
- Physical access control system
- environmnet sferty guards
- energy consumption

### Actual Implementation
#### Smart Door Lock
- RFID card + PIN
- RFID cards expire

#### Z-Wave with Node-RED and OpenHab
Control Kodi with any device in setup
- Problems with Z-Wave

### Demo
very hard to understand
- nice touch with the lamp for the security system
- kind of fun using Kodi for signals
- a screenshot or similar of the UI interface on the phone would have been nice, barely seeable in the video

## The HaBA Way
Our group

## Group 3
### Scenario
- Philip, MC student, always hungry
- automatic turn on of light, oven, coffee machine and alarm
- automatic music in bathroom
- voice assistent turns off all devices
- open door with RFID chip
- very hot -> ventilation starts
- adjusting light via voice assistant (Siri)
- very funny video!!

### Technical Detail
- did not use OpenHab -> too complex
- Hass.io with HomeAssistant
- Components
    - HomeKit
    - Tuya Cloud
    - Spotify
    - MQTT
    - Plex
- Node-RED in HomeAssistant
- Siri with HomeKit

## Group 4
Family Scenario again
- Door Sensor (count how many persons are in a room)
- Smart Lock (2-Factor-Auth), press button on phone for second auth part
- Spotify (problems with Kodi & Spotify), then directly via NodeRed
- Lighting (adapt to natural light)
- Watering system
- Mycroft

### Demo
voice kind of hard to understand again, like in first group
- scenario not really that much about what a person does throughout the day, but more a kind of "I'll show you everything that's possible in my house"
- beautiful plant!! 
- nice monitoring system for watering system
- playing Spotify via Mycroft

## Thoughts/Opinions
The presentations were kind of nice - you got to see a lot of what's possible to do over just one weekend, though it was really very stressful to do the whole project + video in such a short time. A lot of interesting ideas also from our colleagues. The feedback to the project itself can be found in [Lecture 6](../Lecture%206%20-%20Project/ReadMe.md).

I especially liked the idea of group 3 a lot, who automated the whole morning routine. Also their video was probably the best. The video of the last group was also not bad, but it didn't feel like really a person going through the day - so not that much of a user story.
