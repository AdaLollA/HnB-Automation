# Personal Opinion
Since i was absent during this lecture i again had to research what happened from my colleagues as well as their documentation. It seemed that most of the projects were very thorough and that made it hard to follow for some.

Overall i loved Project 3 since everybody got to play around with different sensors and actuators they were interested in. To top that off we even had enough time so that everybody got to experiment around with whatever they were tasked with, which i'm sure helped a lot of people with learning the actual behaviour of the specific IoT devices.
