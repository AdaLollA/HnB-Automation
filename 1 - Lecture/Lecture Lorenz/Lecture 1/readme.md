# Personal Opinion
I think it was a great introduction, though it might have been a bit chaotic for students that are new to IoT. The biggest problem that occured is that i had to explain to many people how the structure of IoTEmpire works and what component is responsible for what functionality. This might have been able to be presented a bit more clearly, however it was made difficult becuase the demonstration had a bug.

I think the hands on example would have been sufficient to make the students understand the system better. So i don't think a change of plan is necessary here.
