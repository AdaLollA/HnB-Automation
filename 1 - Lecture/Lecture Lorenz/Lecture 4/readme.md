# Personal Opinion
Today we finalized the Smart-Lock project which took most of the available time. We also had  very interesting presentations in the morning. I understand that it is necessary to learn the "roots" of IoT and that because of this there were a lot of older protocols within the presentations too, but as a general feedback: Maybe have everyone work on the "more important" bus systems such as 1-Wire, I2C and SPI since these will be the most used ones (probably also throughout the HaBA course).

We also did the KNX quiz, fetched necessary hardware and initialized the follow-up projects.
