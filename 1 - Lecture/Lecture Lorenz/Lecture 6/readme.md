# Personal Opinion
Project 3 implementation was pretty smooth since every team member worked well without interference or having to be reminded of doing so.

My part was to work on the gardening system together with Alex. This was loads of fun since we had to experiment our way through a few tight paths, figuratively speaking.

For the movie, which we thought to have turned out great, we also were all working on it together. Manuel did the video editing afterwards while i played Yeet. The others were working on manipulating sensors and interfaces to get the use cases working out as they should.
