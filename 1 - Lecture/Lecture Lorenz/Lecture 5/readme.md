# Personal Opinion
Since i was sick for this lecture i was gathering the necessary information from my colleagues as well as their documentations. I heard that our presentation was pretty funny and had some less intentional "oopsies" throughout. Kinda makes me wish i was there. The other presentations seem to have been interesting too.

What i really liked about Project 2 is the exportation factor of searching for new things and being able to just "say" that you are going to use it in the implementation while not actually doing so. It removes the fear for feasability which is a major setback for free thinking.

OpenHab itself is a very interesting concept, as well as system. I am happy that my team got to explore through it and connect different devices.
