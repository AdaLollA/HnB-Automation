## 1 - Opening Statements

- Obermayr is pro on home automation because:
	- enhances comfort
	- enhances security
- Schneglberger is con on home automation because:
	- costly term of integration
	- sell soul to one manufacturer/company
- Gstöttner is pro on home automation because:
	- easy to use voice commands
	- use smartphone to control things in your home
	- for elderly people can improve life
	- energy consumption regulation
- Spindlbalker is con on home automation because:
	- security concerns
	- impact systems have on life, children
	- trust issues on manufacturers
	- children ask just the HABA system and won't explore for themself
	- social issues on children
	- to much dependency (getting lazy)
- iris (moderator) is summing up the opening statements
	- summarize pro
	- summarize con


## Starting the discussion

- Impact of IoT has our children?
	- obermayr: 
		- everything has impact on life/kids, impact must not be negative
		- modern technology needs to be get used to
		- children will be dealing more with technology then we are 
	- spindlbalker:
		- pencil is something else than technology (one thing gets them everything else)
		- make children aware of everything works
		- convinience is one side of the coin, learing how life works without getting everything by asking is the other side and a danger
		- critical thinking needs to be learned
	
- first question from the audience:
	- Are you prepared to sacrifice your child's mental stability because you're too lazy to turn on the light via a switch?
		- obermayr:
			- don't gets the questions point
			- röbl: what if the HABA breaks, kiddo doesn't know how to switch a light on
			- smart home is a tool, mental things are not learned by technology. 
		- gstöttner:
			- just let kids access stuff they should be able to use

- second question: Is assisted living really such a boon for people who need it - do you have some more examples for that?
	- gstöttner: people are used to wahsing machines now - why not the same thing with HABA?
	- ulno: wheelchair people use HABA to make their life easier        
   
- schneglberger:
	- comfort is ok
	- keep mind on what happens when system does not work
	- same thing happened with TVs
	- automating just a few things not all

- third question: Kids are using Alexia to ask her to do their homework. Is this really helping them to learn something?
	- obermayr: should be possible to restrict alexa to help with homework
	- spindlbalker: kids shouldn't be allowed to look everything up. Rules would help but it would get too complicated - why not just disabling anyways?
	- obermayr: 
	- gstöttner: made a lot of rules and ignoring every rule - but some rules are really handy. Lock HABA should be easier in the future for some parts of life
	- obermayr: boy with alexa. holiday with parents. asked alexa everything about the holiday were they are spending. boy entertained parents about facts about city. 
	- spindlbalker: sights manipulation (ads)

### next topic: security
- How do cyber threats (e.g. ransomware) pose a problem to fully automated homes?
	- schneglberger: the more components you install, the more connected the software is, the higher is the risk to get virus/trojaner and stuff and realted directly to your home. 
	- obermayr: in the past there was never a problem. second home network for HABA - no issue w/o internet access
- iris: how do normal people integrate HABA?
	- obermayr: a professional does the installation
	- iris: costs?
- You only argue that home automation can be good in some cases. Should really _everyone_ automate their home? 
	- gstöttner:  
	- obermayr: comfort. same reason with dishwashers. it is getting comfortable like having a car
	- schneglberger: cars are also convenient to have, but you can use public transport you will always go for that. scaling problems of huge companies. products and systems are not scalable enough. vienna built a testing city (smart city 2000) one area in vienna. 
	- gstöttner: why is it not scalable? 
	- schneglberger: light bulbs technology stack is not capable of using a lot of them yet
	- obermayr: light bulbs not HABA in my opinion. QNX protocol made for HABA - ability to automate with wired hardware. 
	- gstöttner: bulbs do not communicate with the internet. decrease the uncertainty of the cloud
	- schneglberger: you need to wire yourhome to support this. 
	- spindlbalker: 15000$ to install HABA after you built your home


#### next question: Again with name: I want to LIVE in my home, not be productive all the time. Isn't there a beauty to doing something manually, just because it's relaxing?
- linus: automated lawn mower (relaxing for people to mow the lawn)
- obermayr: you can be lazy and tell the mower to mow it
- obermayr: not bound to your garden you can go hiking

#### next question: isn't denying progress due to fear that over-stimulation happens the same fear that we had of the TV or the phone?
- spindlbalker: be careful with use of HABA
- schneglberger: proven fact that if you use your phone too often can lead to alzheimer. chances rise if we use more such of these technologies

#### Security leak: this case would affect physical things rather than virtual ones, and might threaten life, how can you prevent that?
- gstötter: much more of a problem if bank account gets attacked
- spindlbalker: physical access is bad enough, loss of privacy is important here! hackers can use to blackmail you - university of michigan could 25% unlock smart homes in just 3hrs
- obermayr: 
- schneglberger: one home unlocked --> more homes unlocked easier
- spindlbalker: sit in the car and unlock homes way easier
 
## End of debate
### Open question round from the audience

- input: if someone has access to your home, less worrying than bank account captured: mr. robot as example. turn on everything without you noticing where it is coming from


- question: home automation devices do not have the capability of carrying malicious software" - please provide sources: esp is not capable of that. 
- spindlbalker is completly disagreeing and provides examples for hacking an esp
- both valid points

## Closing statements

- spindelbalker: would you exchange your health and your privacy for comfort? Comopanies selling your data, hackers getting into your home, blackmail you, spying on you. nnot automate your home
- gstöttner: not possible everyone can automate their home - not very reasonable closing statement
- schneglberger: I am not completly against HABA, but at the time now we are not prepared for that yet. Vienna has one of the best smartest cites in the world. This as an example we shoudl research on that much more
- obermayr: for HABA - if we use it responsible. will improve our lifes, same with every technology until now

## Polls
11 participants in the audience

before discussion: 12% for HABA, 88% against
after discussion: 100% against HABA

## Closing from moderator (iris)

## Recap of ulno
ulno said con team had more facts than pro team. pro team defended well 

cyber bullying is getting very serious with HABA

# Smart Lock Implementation

We are using the hardware setup from the lecture before. Extending this with a card-reader hardware and extend NodeRED to integrate a temp-MQTT store implemented with Java.

We were able to implement a two-factor-authentication-flow using NodeRED on mobile to input the code we send with MQTT back to NodeRED and notify the user of the smart lock to input the code.

## Hardware Setup
- Raspberry Pi
- Wemos
- RFID-Sensor
- Lock

## NodeRED
## MQTT-Store
## Telegram Integration
## IFTTT

### Personal Opinion // Lesson Learnt

I found it quite interesting to research about the history of older IoT and automation technology, but in my opinion the presentations were a bit too long. 15 minutes/presentation should have been enough to catch up with the hard facts.

Devloping a smart lock with restricting access to specific devices/persons was really interesting. My part on this was the MQTT Store Simulator
