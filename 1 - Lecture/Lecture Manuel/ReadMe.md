I am using three different emojis to rate each lecture:

- :thumbsup:: good
- :call_me_hand:: could have been better
- :thumbsdown:: bad

#### Lecture 1 :thumbsdown:

Consisted of mostly an overview of home and building automation. Due to problems with the hardware setup we were not able to do any practical examples during that session.

##### Personal Opinion // Lesson Learnt
I found it a bit confusing to see us struggling big times, by just having the problem of a version tag to be added to a file. Otherwise the examples we should implement were quite interesting and I was looking forward to the next session!


#### Lecture 2 :thumbsup:
We were able to come up with all the challenges mentioned in the lecture slides and build the smart lock as a final challenge. We were a bit in a hurry, but it was fun to work with hardware and NodeRED again

##### Personal Opinion // Lesson Learnt
The stress level was a bit disturbing as we wanted to finish off our work during the HBA session. The takeaway is a bit low as it is for our beginners hard to understand the procedure of access, send and receive - so I helped a lot with the implementation.

#### Lecture 3 :thumbsup:
We had the debate planned beforehand. Our group was assigned the task of the mediators. Iris did a very good job on the public part in guiding the debate and asking different questions and throwing the ball to the con- and pro-teams.

##### Personal Opinion // Lesson learnt
For me the debate went very smoothly. The pro team was in a disadvantage as the con-team had very good arguments prepared. Pro team suffered a bit. For me the debate could have been much longer as it was interesting to hear so much different point of views and opinions on the topic.

#### Lecture 4 :thumbsdown:
Today was presentation day on the history of different of busses and protocols. Due to a meeting during the early session I wasn't able to attend to all of the presentations.

##### Personal Opinion // Lesson learnt
I found it quite interesting to research about the history of older IoT and automation technology, but in my opinion the presentations were a bit too long. 15 minutes/presentation should have been enough to catch up with the hard facts.

#### Lecture 5 :thumbsup:
##### Personal Opinion // Lesson learnt

In this lecture we got new challenges to get working. OpenHAB and Home Assistant were very interesting to work with. I may use Home Assistant at home too. Also integrating so many different sensors, lights and other stuff was really cool to get a hands on feeling - aigan a bit short in time. Would have loved to have more time to actually "play" around with the gateways a bit more. Our group did the KNX certificates in this lecture and the exercise in the next one.

#### Lecture 6 :call_me_hand:

##### Personal Opinion // Lesson learnt

We finished the home gateway implementations, what we were working with this session was the Z-Wave plug and KNX. Z-Wave was annoying as we didn't knew about the problems and their solutions. After a long long while we decided to reset the device and lookup in the manual to get it to work.

KNX was frustrating at first, but in my opinion more because we didn't knew how and what to do. After an introduction from Ulno I found it interesting as we got a working setup pretty fast.

#### Lecture 7 :thumbsup:

##### Personal Opinion // Lesson learnt

In final session every team presented their videos and projects they did. We all had a similar setup but different ideas. One group had a family scenario, another one implementing a security layer for a company and a student kind of way to use home automation. We did also a different way in using a home automation-excited man who automated his home all by himself. Because you know. Yeet's the man. Because he can. Yeet is smart!

I would have loved to have more time to talk with the other groups about their projects as we exceeded the lecture time already after the individual presentations.
