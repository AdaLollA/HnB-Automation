#### Lecture 1
Consisted of mostly an overview of home and building automation. Due to problems with the hardware setup we were not able to do any practical examples during that session.

##### Personal Opinion // Lesson Learnt
I found it a bit confusing to see us struggling big times, by just having the problem of a version tag to be added to a file. Otherwise the examples we should implement were quite interesting and I was looking forward to the next session!


#### Lecture 2
We were able to come up with all the challenges mentioned in the lecture slides and build the smart lock as a final challenge. We were a bit in a hurry, but it was fun to work with hardware and NodeRED again

##### Personal Opinion // Lesson Learnt
The stress level was a bit disturbing as we wanted to finish off our work during the HBA session. The takeaway is a bit low as it is for our beginners hard to understand the procedure of access, send and receive - so I helped a lot with the implementation.

#### Lecture 3
We had the debate planned beforehand. Our group was assigned the task of the mediators. Iris did a very good job on the public part in guiding the debate and asking different questions and throwing the ball to the con- and pro-teams.

##### Personal Opinion // Lesson learnt
For me the debate went very smoothly. The pro team was in a disadvantage as the con-team had very good arguments prepared. Pro team suffered a bit. For me the debate could have been much longer as it was interesting to hear so much different point of views and opinions on the topic.

#### Lecture 4
Today was presentation day on the history of different of busses and protocols. Due to a meeting during the early session I wasn't able to attend to all of the presentations.

##### Personal Opinion // Lesson learnt
I found it quite interesting to research about the history of older IoT and automation technology, but in my opinion the presentations were a bit too long. 15 minutes/presentation should have been enough to catch up with the hard facts.

#### Lecture 5
