# Lecture 7 - Presentation

## Chemsident Automation
- more building automation
- company access control system automation
- energy consumption
- safety guards
- smart door lock

### Setup
- Z-Wave
- Node-RED
- openHAB
- Kodi

### Z-Wave
- was a pain
- Exceptions
- Check DB
- Mistake Controller


### Demo Video
- unlocking door not possible after 5 seconds of request happened
- audio wasn't that good quality

### Recap Video
- Sounds played with Kodi
- Z-Wave measurement
- triggering different songs with priority
- problems with NodeRED (auto detect channels)
- problems with threshold (filter in nodered)
- problems with lock because it was not triggering


## Third Group - "Philipp, the Mannequin"

### Video
- Creepy puppet in video
- lamps, ventilation system
- voice assistant (Siri)

### Technical details
- Hass.io
- HomeKit
- NodeRED

- Hass.io (iOS App available)
- Many Components(HomeKit, MQTT, Plex, Spotify, Rest, Hue)

- automated coffee machine (servo + wemos; because analog coffee machine; exactly 20 seconds)

#### Challenges
- WIFI Communication
- Power supply for each device
- power switches were turned off
- Home Automation and NodeRED
- MyCroft didn't work

## Last Group (Family Scenario)
- Door Sensor (opens/closes automatically)
- Smart Lock (2factor; NFC; NodeRED)
- Spotify Integration (Kodi+openHAB; no control via openHAB; NodeRED+Spotify)
- Lighting System
- Watering System
- MyCroft


### Video
- moisture sensor
- mycroft
- automatic light switches/sensors
- watering

### Woophsies
- Hue Lights
- NFC Warning (unauthorized access)
- Turn on/off lights with mycroft
- merge problems in nodeRED
- mycroft and spotify had spotify problems
- MQTT and mycroft (he speaks what mqtt sends)

### Screenshots
- Dashboard
- Door Sensors (which one triggered first)
- MyCroft can speak and triggers Hues


### Conclusion
- problems with internet ate not good for home automation
- Patience needed



## Personal Opinion // Lesson Learnt

The projects and videos were really fun to watch. To be honest I would have loved to see them working in real environment and be able to talk more about the projects in general. But I think the video is a great idea to get a feel of the components and how they could work in real environment.

A bit more time would have been cool as we exceeded session time and I would have liked to have the opportunity to talk to other groups about their projects.
