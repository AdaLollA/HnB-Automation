### Project 2: Presentations
#### My J.A.R.V.I.S.
- RFID chip installed in his hand for garage door 
  - Does he have to get out of the car?

- Garage door that opens when engine starts
  - How does it really decide that the garage door should be opened? what if I have to stop the car (because I forgot something in the house) and then start the engine again?

- A lot of DIY! Very nice!
