* Pro
  * More comfort
  * Enhance security
  * Better environmental footprint
  * Use voice or smartphone to control home
  * Better life for elderly or disabled
  * Better energy consumption
* Con
  * privacy and security concern
  * power loss = loss of function
  * data gets stored
  * costly integration
  * threats and hacking
    * access to network over the weakest device
    * network access = physical control over devices
    * cyber mobbing
* Big focus on education topic
  * should children use smart homes

##### Presentation Preparation

Assigned BACnet topic for preparing a presentation.

BACnet is a communication protocol for building automation and control networks. First developed in 1980's. Quite old standard.

Domains are the industrial area for applications like

- HVAC (heating, ventilating, air-conditioning)
- lighting control
- access control
- fire detection and alarm
- security

Provides mechanisms for automation devices to exchange information, regardless of which building service they perform and protocol services for device and object discovery as well as data sharing.

Requires devices to be compatible with BACnet blocks (BIBB) to work.

Uses LAN technologies to connect between devices

* Ethernet
* MS/TP
* Zigbee
* KNX

Quite flexible if devices are compatible from manufacutrers side. Open-end solution, enables system expansion with large range of devices.

##### Lab Work

RFID reader + smart lock

Done the wiring of the Wemos chips and peripherals, like smart lock and RFID reader. The rest of the team worked on the node-red implementation and mqtt communication.
