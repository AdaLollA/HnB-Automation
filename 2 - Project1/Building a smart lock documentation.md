## Getting started with Raspberry Pi and iOTempower

- downloading [Arduino Studio](https://www.arduino.cc/download_handler.php)
- [Downloading Image](https://github.com/iotempire/iotempower)
- Install [Etcher](https://etcher.io)

- Flash SD Card with Etcher

***

### Notes from Ulno Demonstration
- plug in screen to pi
- switch on an led on wemos when tapping button on another wemos
- dongle = screen
- raspberry pi is used as a gateway
- changing password (help teammember iris and alex)
- plugging in pi to determine wifi network

**DOWNLOAD OF THE IMAGE WAS CORRUPT**

- we need to start over again
- downloading backup image from 10.20.99.155:8000 (ulno pc)

- flashing again

# Adoption phase
- morsing code = setup phase
- start user menu
- yeyeboys (dj-bobo-fanclub)
- iot: iotempire
- iotgateway.local
- Adoption steps:
	- plug in wemos
	- press button twice
	- select from menu on iotgateway 

- using the the display wemos for checking and adopting the other wemos
- we deleted all node files, so we have to use another raspberry pi image to start over again
