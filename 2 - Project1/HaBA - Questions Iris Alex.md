# Home and Building Automation
- What are the main problems?
  - [Walled Off Internet](https://www.cmswire.com/cms/internet-of-things/7-big-problems-with-the-internet-of-things-024571.php)
    - number of cross border attacks will start pushing national governments towards breaking up the internet in national, or even regional “walled gardens"
    - economic protectionism, regulatory divergence, loss of government power relative to global online companies
  - [AI-Built Security Issues](https://www.cmswire.com/cms/internet-of-things/7-big-problems-with-the-internet-of-things-024571.php)
    - next big target for ransomware are likely to be cloud service providers
    - they provide a single point of failure for hundreds of businesses, government entities, critical infrastructures, and healthcare organizations
    - soon, malware completely created by machines based on automated vulnerability detection and data analysis
  - [Botnet Problems](https://www.cmswire.com/cms/internet-of-things/7-big-problems-with-the-internet-of-things-024571.php)
    - millions of connected consumer devices make a wide attack surface for hackers
    - biggest security challenge is the creation of DDoS attacks that employ swarms of poorly-protected consumer devices
  - [Limited AI](https://www.cmswire.com/cms/internet-of-things/7-big-problems-with-the-internet-of-things-024571.php)
    - more and more data will be used to create data associations
    - some variables may display strong correlation by pure chance
  - [Home Invasion](https://www.peerbits.com/blog/biggest-iot-security-challenges.html)
    - IoT devices have given rise to the home automation
    - can expose your IP address that can pinpoint to your residential address
    - if you’re using IoT devices in your security systems, then there is a possibility that they might compromise as well as leave your house at a huge potential threat
  - [Remote Vehicle Access](https://www.peerbits.com/blog/biggest-iot-security-challenges.html)
    - Smart cars with the help of connected IoT devices
    - due its IoT association, it also possesses a greater risk of a car hijack
    - skilled hacker might hijack by getting the access of your smart car through the remote access
- Why is it still not widely adopted?
  - The IoT exposes things to the network, but there are still issues/problems with doing this in a [controlled way](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7196499).

  - [Limitations due to hardware:](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7196499)
    - Computational and energy constraint: mostly battery driven devices - expensive algorithms cannot be ported directly to these devices
    - Memory constraint: limited RAM and Flash memory
    - Tamper resitent packaging: Might be deployed in remote regions and left unattended - attacker could tamper devices by device capture

  - [Limitations due to software:](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7196499)
    - Embedded software constraint: thin network protocol stacks - devices might lack enough security modules -> protocol stack should be thin but robust & fault tolerant
    - Dynamic security patch: remote reprogrammng might not be possible for IoT devices - protocol stack might not have ability to receiving and integration new code/library

  - [Limitations due to network:](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=7196499)
    - Mobility
    - Scalability
    - Multiplicity of devices
    - Multiplicity of communication medium: devices connect via a range of wireless links - difficult to find a comprehensive security protocol
    - Multi-Protocol Networking: devices might use proprietary network procotol for communication with proximal networks
    - Dynamic network topology: devices might join or leave a network at anytime from anywhere

- Why is it getting more attractive today than ever?
    - [Artificial Intelligence is getting better and better](https://www.itbusinessedge.com/slideshows/iot-top-7-challenges-07.html)
    - [Devices are cheaper, faster, and more functionality](https://wustl.instructure.com/courses/64/pages/why-iot-now-converging-factors)

- What role do frameworks and gateways play? Give examples!
  - [IoT plaforms/frameworks:](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214212617302934)
    - AWS IoT from Amazon
    - ARM Bed from ARM & other partners
    - Azure IoT Suite from Microsoft
    - Brillo/Weave from Google
    - Calvin from Ericsson
    - HomeKit from Apple
    - Kura from Eclipse
    - SmartThings from Samsung

  - [Frameworks role:](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214212617302934)
    - indentify structure which coordinates and controls processes are conducted by various IoT elements
    - structure: set of rules, protocols and regulations
    - organize way of processing data and exchange messages between involved parties
    - should support high level implementation of IoT applications
    - hide complexity of infrastructure protocols
      
  - [Gateways role:](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5703542)
    - sensors have no uniform standardization
    - settle with heterogenity between various sensor networks and mobile communication networks or internet
    - bridge traditional communication networks with sensor networks -> easier network communication
    - What is the role/problem of the cloud?

What is the role/problem of the cloud?
  - [Cloud Attacks](https://www.cmswire.com/cms/internet-of-things/7-big-problems-with-the-internet-of-things-024571.php)
    - large amount of the data for IoT will be stored in the cloud -> primary targets of attacks
    - takedown of cloud provider may cost 50 to 120 billion dollars
