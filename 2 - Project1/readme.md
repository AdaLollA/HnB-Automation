# Plan

We are the moderators for the debate. Therefore we created a [plan](plan.md) an what we will focus the most. The [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=xVmShH0-9xY) ulno provided was very helpful and guided us through our planning phase. Our group members met two days before the debate and did an example video we uploaded to [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iGxVoLWiEhA&feature=youtu.be), where you can see the result of how such a debate could look like. Also we documented our plan to come up with a [guidance](Moderator_Notes_Intelligence_Squared.md) during the live debate.

When preparing for the debate, we [summarized](main_topics_of_teams.md) the topics each team (pro/con) posted on our discord server.
