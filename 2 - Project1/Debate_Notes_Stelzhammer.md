## Round 1: Opening Statements
### PRO1:
  - loves home automation -> loves the convenience
  - home automation could be an issue for elderly people (but he is pro?)
  - security is not necessarily just negative but can also be positive
  - thinks the comfort outweighs the issues of home automation

### PRO2:
    - could improve the lives, especially for elder people

### CON1:
  - security issue
  - losing the ability to live on your own

### CON2:
    - "elephant in the room": security
      - multiple devices that are expensive or cheaper
    - impact devices have on the people (especially children) -> you use the systems too much, you become too lazy. you completely depend on the devices
    - proven it has an impact on 


## Round 2: Rebuttal
Christoph Obermayr was asked about Roland's statement that Home Automation has a negative impact on people.
C.O. argues that the devices can also have a positive impact. For example, children have to grow up with the devices and learn to use them. Additionally, you can minimize[sic] (meaning 'limit') the use of the devices.
R.S. agrees that children need to be taught. There is a difference in providing a pencil in comparison to devices that give you everything you need, without any effort.

### Audience Question:
```
@Obermayer "everything has an impact" - Are you prepared to sacrifice your child's mental stability because you're too lazy to turn on the light via a switch?
```
C.O. did not understand the question, David Röbl elaborated further:
In a research, they found if children in an early age are not presented with some natural sources and they are not developing mental connections to these natural sources to get what they want.

### Audience Question:
```
@pro team: Is assisted living really such a boon for people who need it - do you have some more examples for that?
```
Ulno ellaborated further:
He has some friends in a wheelchair and Home Automation is actually a boon to those people because it helps them operate in their own home.

R.G. agrees that people with disabilities can benefit from home automation (e.g. you can use your voice to operate devices). 

M.S. is suggesting that people only automate some parts of their home, not all of it.

### Audience Question:
```
Kids are using Alexia[sic] to ask her to do their homework. Is this really helping them to learn something?
```
S.DM. ellaborated further:
Especially with Math homework, children are getting too lazy and use Alexa to solve their (for example) multiplication equations. 

C.M. suggests restricting the use of Alexa to a certain timeframe, where it is not allowed to answer questions (e.g. to the geographic homework). He does not see a problem with using Alexa to answer questions, as the answers to these questions can easily be looked up in a book as well. If they "learn by listening" they also gain experience through an additional channel.
R.S. disagrees with C.M.'s suggestion. He argues that they miss out on additional information when looking up information in a book. 

### Audience Question:
```
How do cyberthreats (e.g. ransomware) pose a threat to fully automated homes?
```

M.S. describes the problem of being locked out of your own home. The more components you install and the more connected everything is, the higher is the risk to be infected by a virus or ransomware. In former times, lock pickers had to get into the home by opening windows. Now, it would be possible to gain access to a home via a lightbulb.
C.O. argues that he was at the Oberösterreichische Versicherung recently and they told him that they never had a problem in the past that someone broke into their home by using software. They still do that in the regular way by cracking doors or windows. He infers that this is not a problem.

### Audience Question:
```
You only argue that home automation can be good in some case. Should everyone automate their home?
```
R.G. states that not everyone should automate their home by themselves. They should let professionals do the work to avoid security breaches. I.P. asks again whether he thinks that everyone should automate their homes. He compares it to buying a car: if you do not need a car, why would you buy a car? I.P. states that the thing with IT is that you never really need it but it is a question of comfort.
C.O. argues that many people indeed do it for the comfort. However, in the industry it helps with productivity. The same can be applied to home automation. If you do not have to do the vacuuming or wash the dishes yourself, you can save time by not having to do your daily chores manually, and instead have a vacuum robot do the work.
M.S. argues that the industry is not ready for home automation yet. The products and the system seperately are not scaling well enough. 

### Audience Question:
```
I want to live in my home, not be productive all the time. Isn't there beauty in doing something manually, just because it's relaxing?
```
L.H. elaborates further and takes mowing the lawn as an example. For some, it can be relaxing to be outside and mow the lawn yourself. C.O. argues that it can be relaxing to just start the mowing robot. 

In summary, this question did not really go anywhere and the answers, most of the time, missed the point entirely.

### Audience Question:
```
Security leaks only affect virtual things (e.g. bank account). In the case of home automation, security leaks affect physical things which you cannot escape.
```
R.G. provides the argument that having your bank account hacked has a more severe impact on your life than having your home being hacked. I.P. adds that in the future people maybe want to control their bank account with IoT devices. 
R.S. argues that there is an additional loss of privacy if cameras e.g. are hacked. This information can be used to blackmail the owner. Two points: there was a restaurant that had a smart security system (locks, alarm system, ...). Hackers disabled this system without the restaurant owner noticing. The university of Michigan, for example, was able to take over smart homes in 25% of the homes they tested.

### I.P., the MC, moved on from Audience Questions to Live Questions. 
The Live Question section was very messy. The audience did not ask questions but added their opinion. Some debaters (*cough* C.O. *cough*) did not let the people in the audience finish which was really annoying. Once the other debates chimed in, the debate started working again.


### Live Question:
```
According to C.O. 'Home Automation software is not capable of holding malicious software'. D.R. requests some sources that prove that this argument holds.
```
C.O. could not really provide any source that his arguments hold. Even Ulno chimed in and told him that he could put a virus on such devices anytime.
R.S. cites an article where a camera was connected to the internet and soon after it was visible on the internet. Less than 100 seconds after that, it was infected and started building a bot net inside the home automation network. These devices can then be used to take control of the home automation devices.


### I.P., the MC, closed the debate and told the debaters to give their closing statements.

## Round 3: Closing Statements
### Roland Spindelbalker
```
Would you exchange your health and your privacy for a bit more comfort? Is this comfort worth giving up your private lives in your homes to companies which use this data and store it on their servers, just to sell it to governments interested in the data, to hackers who can use it to infiltrate your home or spy on you/blackmail you? Would you give up your ability to live a self-responsible life for a bit more of comfort? I think we should not exchange your health and privacy for a bit more comfort. I strongly advice you to not automate your home!
```

### Robert Gstöttner
``` 
Since the question is 'Should everyone automate their homes?', I think we have to consider what 'everyone' means because it is not possible for everyone to automate their home. There are many people who don't have access to internet or don't know what the internet is. I can't say 'should everyone fly?' because not everyone can fly.
```

### Martin Schneglberger
```
I'm not completely against home automation or smart homes. At the moment we are not prepared for it yet. Vienna got an award for being one of the smartest city. They are providing test scenarios and test villages to see how home automation influences us and the economy, our energy consumption. We should enhance the technologies, we should test them out. Maybe every larger city should create such villages to see how this works for us and what the alternatives are. We should invest into this technology.
```

### Christoph Obermayr
```
Now it's hard because some of my points Martin already said. I am pro-home automation. If we use it responsible it will improve our lives. It is like any other technology we had. Use home automation and improve our lives.
```

### I.P., the MC, asks the audience to participate in the vote whether the audience was swayed by the arguments or not.
