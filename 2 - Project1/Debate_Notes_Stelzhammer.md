## Round 1: Opening Statements
### PRO1:
  - loves home automation -> loves the convenience
  - home automation could be an issue for elderly people (but he is pro?)
  - security is not necessarily just negative but can also be positive
  - thinks the comfort outweighs the issues of home automation

PRO2:
    - could improve the lives, especially for elder people

CON1:
  - security issue
  - losing the ability to live on your own
CON2:
    - "elephant in the room": security
      - multiple devices that are expensive or cheaper
    - impact devices have on the people (especially children) -> you use the systems too much, you become too lazy. you completely depend on the devices
    - proven it has an impact on 


Round 2: Rebuttal
Christoph Obermayr was asked about Roland's statement that Home Automation has a negative impact on people.
C.O. argues that the devices can also have a positive impact. For example, children have to grow up with the devices and learn to use them. Additionally, you can minimize[sic] (meaning 'limit') the use of the devices.
R.S. agrees that children need to be taught. There is a difference in providing a pencil in comparison to devices that give you everything you need, without any effort.

Audience Question:
```
@Obermayer "everything has an impact" - Are you prepared to sacrifice your child's mental stability because you're too lazy to turn on the light via a switch?
```
C.O. did not understand the question, David Röbl elaborated further:
In a research, they found if children in an early age are not presented with some natural sources and they are not developing mental connections to these natural sources to get what they want.

Audience Question:
```
@pro team: Is assisted living really such a boon for people who need it - do you have some more examples for that?
```
Ulno ellaborated further:
He has some friends in a wheelchair and Home Automation is actually a boon to those people because it helps them operate in their own home.

R.G. agrees that people with disabilities can benefit from home automation (e.g. you can use your voice to operate devices). 

M.S. is suggesting that people only automate some parts of their home, not all of it.

Audience Question:
```
Kids are using Alexia[sic] to ask her to do their homework. is this really helping them to learn something?
```
S.DM. ellaborated further:
Especially with Math homework, children are getting too lazy and use Alexa to solve their (for example) multiplication equation. 


Audience Question:
```
On security: How do cyber threats (e.g. ransomware) pose a problem to fully automated homes?
```
