# Notes of Intelligence² debate
We watched an Intelligence² debate to get a feeling for how the moderator shall behave during the debate. Following a few notes can be found.

## Beginning of debate
1. present debaters (names)
2. present topic - what is the topic and what is the exact question that the debates are for or against
3. present debaters in detail (what do they work, which fields do they work in, ...)
4. announce round 1

## Round 1
In round 1 every debater present his/her starting points
- take turns with pro and con persons
- after a pro person, a con person should hold his/her starting speech and vice versa

## Round 2
After round 1 the topic is stated once again. Process of round 2:
- moderator presents topics of each group - "group ... raised the question that..." etc.
- debaters address each other directly and take questions from audience and moderator
- maybe if nobody is starting - choose one person to introduce topic (discussion might be started with this)
- or ask specific person about opinion to a specific point
- always give a person whose point was directly adressed time to respond
- debaters should talk to audience not to moderator - if a debater starts talking only toward moderator, remind them to talk to the audience
- moderator could ask whether he/she understood a point correctly - could also help the audience to understand the mentioned point
- ask audience for questions (audience should not debate with debaters, only think of good questions)

## Round 3
Closing statements

## Closing of Moderator
- Thank audience for questioning
- Eventually come up with questions at the end and ask for all 4 viewpoints (no debate anymore)
- Votes of audience
