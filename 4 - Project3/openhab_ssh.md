# Openhab on Raspberry via SSH
- to connect to the SSH to work with the openhab console on the Raspberry, there are two possibilities we tried:
    1. over command line:
        ```
        ssh -p 22 openhab@localhost
        ```
    2. with putty: enter IP-address of Raspberry where Openhab is running, set port to 22
- Important is to set the port to 22
