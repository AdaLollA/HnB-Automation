Changes force us to think in new ways. 

 - security will play a bigger role in the future
 - maximum efficiency
 - increase comfort for the well being of users

Systems are going to become more like living organisms:

 - adapt to requirements of users (modularity)
 - everchanging
 - standardized interfaces "plug and go"

Seamless technology integration into logistic operation.

Flexibility improvement throughout most areas (e.g. public transport)

In the future we will create new synergies to increase performance.

Lighting and climate control.

Open-Door-Concept and personal navigation

Safety measures will be deployed automatically as needed.

Realtime information exchange.
